          I'm a software developer, video game creator, and lifelong explorer! My ultimate passion in life is learning new things, and challenging myself with new opportunities. From computer programming to amateur bodybuilding, testing the limits of my knowledge and dedication is what drives me in life!

          My main professional goal is front-end development for web applications, primarily using Typescript with React/Redux.

                    I interned at JP Morgan Chase & Co. during the summer of 2018. While there, I made a really cool Python script for my team to easily delete build artifacts from their complex continuous integration pipeline. Senior devs liked it so much they asked me to expand it to be a web application so every developer in our line of business could use it! I used Flask as my server-side engine, and Jinja2 as my templating engine.

                  <p>
                    I deployed my web application to the internal cloud infrastructure, which was based on Cloud Foundry technology. I also hooked in a logging microservice with the help of Splunk, so we could keep track of how many times my application was used (spoiler, it was a lot!).

                  <p>I interned at Harris Corporation during the summers of 2016 and 2017. My first summer's task was automatically generating hundreds of pages of government documentation. I used Python as the base of my script, SQL to query databases for relevant information, and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">pywin32</a> to format everything in Microsoft Word.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>My returning summer, I was tasked with creating and configuring Jenkins pipelines for the GPSIII flight and test code. I accomplished this by developing some Batch scripts which Jenkins would run every night to pull code from source, and do the complex setup to build. </p>

                      Pushing the limits of my mind and body is what drives me, and bodybuilding is the ultimate combination of the two. I started my journey in January of 2017, and have been dedicated ever since. This personal pursuit has taught me the merit of discipline, and the satisfaction of hard work.

                      Playing video games have always been one of my favorite hobbies, so I thought "why not make my own?" I participated as a member of the <a href="https://sgdc.ml">Stevens Game Developement Club</a> for three years, competing in their "Game Jam" competitions. A game jam is short period of time in which to make a game; it could last for a few months, a week, or only 48 hours!

                    <p>
                      I have recieved critical acclaim for my games, including three 1st place awards, and four "top 3" placings: more than any club member during my activity!
